      <p>
        My name is Deya. I was born in Kathmandu, Nepal and I grew up in
        Barcelona, Spain. My passion for life is to keep: self-improving. My
        hobbies are to paint and create unique pieces of pottery and clay
        products. I recently started my journey to be a runner too! I studied
        Tourism for college and I did my masters in Marketing and Sales. I am
        currently working at a co-working space that allows me to be in direct
        contact with people from very diverse backgrounds. As for my future, I
        hope to one day work as a Front-end developer where I get to potray my
        creative side. Keywords: Social Media Strategy, Content Creation,
        Marketing Research, UI & UX, Javascript, Hosting, GitHub, API, Bootstrap
